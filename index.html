    <p class="p">I like reading books because when I read I can sit down at a quiet place and just forget about the world around me for a while. Sometimes when I feel like I have a million things to do I take a break, make a cup of tea and cuddle up in the corner of the sofa with a good book.</p>
    <p class="p">I think there are so many different kinds of books. You can vary between reading novels with a lot of love or more educational books. Personally I think you can learn something in every book.It's really funny to try to identify with the characters of the book and to imagine the environment.</p>
